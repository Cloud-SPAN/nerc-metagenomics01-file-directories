![A comic figure explains that: "Long ago, in another age, I mastered these dark arts. But I now endeavor to live my life such that I never need them.Their power leads only to ruin". Caption: My response whenever anyone asks me to mess around with filesystems](fig/xkcd-comic-file-systems.png)

Welcome to the first lesson in Cloud-SPAN's **Prenomics** course, which will give you the skills and practice you need to feel comfortable using the command line for future analyses.

Knowing how your file system is organised...                                                                                      


> ## Getting Started
>
> This lesson assumes **no prior experience** with the tools covered in the course.
> However, this course is designed to lead on to the Cloud-SPAN Genomics course, for which  learners are expected to have some familiarity with biological concepts,
> including the concept of genomic variation within a population. 
>
> This lesson is part of a course that uses data hosted on an Amazon Machine Instance (AMI). Workshop participants will be given information on how to log-in to the AMI during the course.
> Information on preparing for the course is provided on the [Cloud-SPAN Genomics Course setup page](https://cloud-span.github.io/genomics01-intro/setup.html).

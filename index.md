Welcome to the first lesson in Cloud-SPANâ€™s **Metagenomics with High Performance Computing** course!

Over the next two lessons we will cover the foundational skills and knowledge needed for the rest of the course. Once you are comfortable with these skills, we can move on to applying them to a metagenomics analysis workflow.

In this lesson we will learn how the files and directories on your computer are structured, as well as logging onto the cloud and using the command line (also known as the shell) for the first time. It is heavily based on the first lesson of our [Prenomics course](https://cloud-span.github.io/prenomics00-intro/).

But first, to keep things tidy and easily accessible, create a folder (or directory) to keep everything related to this course: your login key file, your notes, data, etc.  We will then download your login key file to that folder and change its access permissions for the reasons given below. Finally we will login into your instance with ssh.

## Create a folder for the course and download your login key file to that folder

1. **Create the folder** *cloudspan* in your *Desktop*.

   In your Desktop, click the right button of the mouse to open the File Explorer/Manager menu, and then left click on New and then on Folder, in Windows, or New Folder in Linux Gnome.

   Name the folder *cloudspan*

   Later you can change the name of the folder and move it somewhere else.

2. **Download your login key file** to the folder you just created.

   Click on the link embedded in the email you received from the Cloud-SPAN team.
   
   **Mac users** may need to Click on 'download' when the file says it can't be opened.

   If your browser asks you "where do you want to download the file?", choose the directory for the course you just created.

   Otherwise, drag and drop your login key file from wherever it was downloaded to the folder for the course you created.
